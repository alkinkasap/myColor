Beatiful colors to keep in mind
------

I've created this to keep good looking colors avaiable for later use. Every color group has a link above them so i can reach the source later on as well.
You can see live version on [this adress](http://alkinkasap.net/myColor).

Project took a couple of hours so don't expect a good interface or experience. Copy to clipboard will be added soon. I hope.

Another idea is to let users to add colors. Need some back-end and i dont have time for now.
